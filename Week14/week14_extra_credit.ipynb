These ideas were relevant and actionable, giving me a clear direction for broadening the scope of my study.\n",

While it mentioned potential sources like WHO or CDC, having clickable, up-to-date links would have been more efficient. Its responses were well-organized and made sense, but integrating actionable steps or tools (e.g., code snippets for analysis) alongside suggestions could enhance the conversation. Overall, it excelled in brainstorming and project refinement but could have been more hands-on with implementation guidance."
